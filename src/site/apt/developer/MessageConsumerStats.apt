*----+--+
||<<Stat Name>>||<<Description>>|
*----+--+
|messagesConsumed|Number of messages consumed since start|
*----+--+
|markCalls|Number of times mark is called.|
*----+--+
|resetCalls|Number of times reset is called|
*----+--+


 Databus consumer has one reader for each partition. The metrics are emitted at context <<consumerName>>, <<topicName>> , <<consumerNumber>> and <<PartitionId>> by each partition reader.


*----+--+----+
||Stat Name||Description|| Default Value|
*----+--+----+
|messagesReadFromSource|Number of messages read from the source partition| 0 |
*----+--+----+

*----+--+----+
|handledExceptions|Number of times exceptions are handled| 0 |
*----+--+----+
|waitTimeUnitsNewFile|Number of times consumer waited for new file creation. Actual waiting time will be this counter times the messaging.consumer.waittime.forfilecreate| 0 |

*----+--+----+
|latestMinuteAlreadyRead | Time(in milli seconds) corresponding to the minute which is already read| 0 |
*----+--+----+
|latestDirectoryLagTime | Time difference in minutes from current system time to latest minute directory which is already read| -1 |

|lastWaitTimeForNewFile | Last Time (in milliseconds) at which partition reader waited for a new file| 0 |
*----+--+----+
|readerWaitLagTime | Time difference in minutes from current system time to the last time when reader waited for a new file| -1 |
*----+--+----+
|\<fsuri\>-list|Number of List ops for file systerm of URI \<fsuri\>| 0 |
*----+--+----+
|\<fsuri\>-open|Number of Open ops for file system of URI \<fsuri\>(In case of stream type LOCAL/MERGED = 0)| 0 |
